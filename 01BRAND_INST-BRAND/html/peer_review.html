      <p>Peer review is an editing process applied to research articles before publication. Briefly, the process goes like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The author sends their paper to a journal for approval.</li>
        <li>The journal sends the paper to other experts in the field to read and review. (The experts are the author's peers, thus the term "peer review.")</li>
        <li>Reviewers can recommend the journal publish the paper as-is, publish it with edits, or not publish it at all.</li>    
        <li>The journal sends the paper back to the author if it needs editing.</li>
        <li>The author chooses whether or not to incorporate the suggested changes and may respond to reviewers' comments.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process repeats until the journal deems that an article is ready for publication.</p>
