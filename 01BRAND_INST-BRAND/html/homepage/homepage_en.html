                    OneSearch provides simple, one-stop searching for all of the library's physical collections as well as many of our online collections. It's also a portal to manage your research and your library account.  Start typing in the search box to view search scope options.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Library Catalog:</strong> Your first stop to connect to items that the Library owns or has immediate access to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brandeis and More:</strong> Your second stop if you want to broaden your search beyond Brandeis. Request materials from other libraries through Interlibrary Loan.</li>
                        <li><strong>Course Reserves:</strong> Search for books and films that have been set aside for your courses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Archives and Special Collections:</strong> Search for rare and unique materials (both physical and digital) held by Brandeis Library.
                        </a></li>
                        <li><strong>Brandeis ScholarWorks:</strong> Search for research and creative work created by Brandeis faculty, students, and staff.

                </p>
                <p>Although OneSearch results can include materials that the Library doesn't own, you can request them through <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/library/borrowing/ill/index.html"></a>Interlibrary Loan.</p>
